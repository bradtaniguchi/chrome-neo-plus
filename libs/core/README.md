# core

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

This library hosts the "core" application pages (besides the app-bar),
that are not part of any of the feature libraries.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test core` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## TODO

- add type-doc
- add storybook
